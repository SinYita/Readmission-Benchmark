LACE Index Baseline Model - Summary Report
==========================================

METHODOLOGY:
The LACE index is a validated clinical prediction tool for hospital readmission risk.
It combines four key factors:

L - Length of stay (0-7 points)
  • <1 day: 0 points
  • 1 day: 1 point  
  • 2 days: 2 points
  • 3 days: 3 points
  • 4-6 days: 4 points
  • 7-13 days: 5 points
  • ≥14 days: 7 points

A - Acuteness of admission (0-3 points)
  • Emergency/Urgent: 3 points
  • Elective: 0 points

C - Comorbidities via Charlson Index (0-5 points)
  • Based on ICD-9 diagnoses
  • Weighted by condition severity
  • Capped at 5 points for LACE

E - Emergency visits in prior 6 months (0-4 points)
  • 0 visits: 0 points
  • 1 visit: 1 point
  • 2 visits: 2 points
  • 3 visits: 3 points
  • ≥4 visits: 4 points

RESULTS INTERPRETATION:
• The model shows low predictive performance (Test R² = -0.15, AUC = 0.125)
• This suggests readmission prediction is challenging with LACE alone
• The low readmission rate (8.5%) creates class imbalance issues
• LACE may work better for risk stratification than binary prediction

CLINICAL INSIGHTS:
• Mean LACE score: 10.0 ± 3.0 (moderate risk range)
• Emergency admissions comprise majority of cases
• Length of stay is primary contributor to LACE score
• Comorbidities show negative correlation (unexpected, may need review)

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
1. Address class imbalance with sampling techniques
2. Add temporal features (time-to-readmission, seasonal effects)
3. Include medication, procedure, and vital sign data
4. Consider ensemble methods combining LACE with other predictors
5. Validate on larger, more diverse patient populations
6. Use appropriate evaluation metrics for imbalanced data (precision, recall, F1)

LIMITATIONS:
• Small sample size (129 admissions, 11 readmissions)
• MIMIC-III demo data may not be representative
• Simple linear regression may be insufficient for complex relationships
• Missing data handling could be improved
• No external validation performed

CONCLUSION:
While the LACE index provides a structured approach to readmission risk assessment,
this implementation shows that additional features and more sophisticated modeling
approaches are needed for accurate readmission prediction in this dataset.
